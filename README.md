The ApeX AMM – or just ApeX for short – is a minimal, gas-efficient automated market maker (AMM) protocol that facilitates NFT-to-token swaps (and vice versa) using customizable bonding curves. ApeX supports ERC721 and ERC1155 NFTs, as well as all ETH and ERC20 tokens.

Liquidity providers (LPs) can deposit assets into single-sided buy or sell pools, or into dual-sided trade pools which buy and sell NFTs with an optional spread to capture trading fees.

Similar to other floor NFT protocols, ApeX makes no distinction between different ERC721 IDs. Pools that are willing to buy or sell NFTs will return the same price no matter which NFT is sent in or out from the collection.
